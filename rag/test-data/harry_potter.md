# Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

## Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were a perfectly normal couple living a perfectly normal life. Their world is turned upside down by a series of strange events: owls flying during the day, shooting stars appearing over Kent, and people in peculiar cloaks celebrating in the streets. The whispers are all about the downfall of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, and the miraculous survival of a baby boy named Harry Potter.

That night, Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, meets Professor McGonagall outside the Dursley's home. They confirm the tragic news: James and Lily Potter have been killed by Voldemort. However, when Voldemort tried to kill their infant son, Harry, the curse rebounded, leaving the dark lord vanquished and Harry with only a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.

The giant Rubeus Hagrid arrives on a flying motorcycle, carrying the baby. With heavy hearts, they leave the orphaned Harry on the Dursleys' doorstep with a letter of explanation. The boy who lived is left to grow up with his only remaining family, completely unaware of the magical world that awaits him.

## Chapter 2: The Vanishing Glass

Nearly ten years pass. Harry's life is one of misery and neglect. He lives in a cupboard under the stairs and is treated like a servant by his cruel Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their spoiled, bullying son, Dudley. Harry is small and skinny, with untidy black hair and his mother's bright green eyes.

On Dudley's eleventh birthday, the family visits the zoo. While looking at a large boa constrictor, Harry is surprised to find he can communicate with it. As Dudley shoves him aside to get a better look, the glass front of the enclosure mysteriously vanishes. The snake slithers free, causing panic. The Dursleys, convinced Harry is to blame for the magical incident, punish him severely upon their return.

## Chapter 3: The Letters from No One

During the summer holidays, a letter arrives addressed specifically to `Mr. H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs`. Before Harry can read it, Uncle Vernon snatches it. This single letter is followed by a flood of identical letters, delivered by an ever-increasing number of owls.

Uncle Vernon's attempts to stop the letters become more and more desperate. He boards up the mail slot and seals every crack in the house. When hundreds of letters shoot out of the fireplace, he snaps completely, forcing the entire family to flee their home in an attempt to escape the magical post.

## Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Keys

Uncle Vernon's frantic escape leads them to a miserable, tiny shack on a rock far out at sea. He believes they are finally safe from any deliveries. As a storm rages outside on the eve of Harry's eleventh birthday, Harry counts down the seconds to midnight.

At the stroke of twelve, a thunderous *BOOM* shakes the hut. The door is blasted from its hinges, and a colossal figure enters. It is Rubeus Hagrid. He wishes Harry a happy birthday, gives him a slightly squashed chocolate cake, and delivers the news that will change his life forever: "Harry – yer a wizard."

## Chapter 5: Diagon Alley

Hagrid tells a stunned Harry the truth about his past: his parents were a famous witch and wizard murdered by Lord Voldemort, and Hogwarts is a real school for magic where Harry is enrolled.

The next day, Hagrid takes Harry to a hidden pub in London called the Leaky Cauldron, where everyone seems to know who Harry is. From a back courtyard, Hagrid taps a sequence of bricks, revealing a magical, bustling street called Diagon Alley. It is here that Harry gets his first real taste of the wizarding world. He withdraws a fortune left by his parents from Gringotts, the goblin-run bank. He buys his school supplies: spellbooks, potion ingredients, and finally, at Ollivanders wand shop, he is chosen by a wand that shares a core with the very one that gave him his scar—Lord Voldemort's. Harry's new life has officially begun.
